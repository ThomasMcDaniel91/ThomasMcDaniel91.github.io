title: Video Game Sales
---
The data set used for this project was about video game sales from 1980-2020. I wanted to see if I could build a model to predict the sales that a game would get based on this information. I decided to use mean absolute error as my metric of accuracy for my model and the 2 models I chose were a linear regression model and a tree based random forest regression.

I started with a baseline mean absolute error of $588,293.95 using this code:

```python
guess = df['Global_Sales'].mean()
#making a list of guesses the same length as my global sales column
guess = [guess] * len(df['Global_Sales'])
baseline = mean_absolute_error(df['Global_Sales'], guess)
# changing the baseline to dollar amounts(currently in millions)
baseline = round(baseline * 1_000_000, 2)
print('The MAE in dollars for the baseline is: $' + str(baseline) + '.')
```

Here is a headshot of the dataframe I am working with with all the column names included.

For cleaning up my data I chose to drop the regional sales columns(NA, EU, JP and other) and the name column as well because it had 11,600+ unique values in a dataframe with only 16,000 rows.

With the remaining columns, I did a simple OneHotEncoding with my linear regression model. This model lowered the mean absolute error to $564,092.02, which beat the baseline by $24,201 on guessing the global sales. 

The random forest regression was my second model I used to attempt a more accurate MAE. With this model, using the same features as my linear model, I managed to use randomized search CV to tune my hyper parameters and get a MAE of $502,871.53. This model managed to get a lower MAE than the linear one by $61,220.49.

#### Some exploration of the dataset with visualizations

The below graph shows the global sales(in millions) for all the rating brackets of video games in the dataset. It would seem that games rated 'E' for everyone have had the highest sales total with 'M' for mature and 'T' for teen almost even and then 'E10+' for everyone over the age of 10 trailing by quite a bit, roughly _800 million_ behind mature and teen rated games.

The other 2 ratings have some strange things going on with them, one is 'k-a' which stood for "kids through adults" was actually renamed to 'E' in 1998 so any ratings after that year won't contain any k-a. The other rating is also 'A' for adult, which, as the name implies, are for adults only. AO-rated games can contain higher levels of violent, profane, sexual, or pornographic content than games rated M.

A couple of interesting observations on this graph that I noticed initially were that games rated 'E' had a huge success between 2001 and 2010 as well but shrunk into a much smaller amount if we don't account for the null values. The games rated 'M' for mature have stayed at a small yet consistant count released per year with the same constraints in mind.

Here is the same graph with the null values of the rating column removed.

The graph below is actually an interactive graph that let's you hover over it and see the name of the game for each point, I know you wanted to know what that is point above all the rest. (try to guess what it is before you look)
