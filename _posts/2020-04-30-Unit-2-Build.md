Some people refer to the birth of video games as British professor A.S. Douglas' OXO or tic-tac-toe. Others say it was when the first home console was released, which was 1967 by a team at Sanders Associates, Inc. led by Ralph Baer called "The Brown Box". After some controversy and copyright lawsuits the games really started branching out in the early-mid 1980s which is where this data begins. From the first graph you can see the beginning in 1980 of the dataset where there is a slight spike in games being made in the very early 1980s and then it settles down on the lower end of the graph all the way until about 1991 when the release of games starts to really pick up and peak at just over 1,400 games released in 2008 and 2009.

The below graph shows the global sales(in millions) for all the rating brackets of video games in the dataset. It would seem that games rated 'E' for everyone have had the highest sales total with 'M' for mature and 'T' for teen almost even and then 'E10+' for everyone over the age of 10 trailing by quite a bit, roughly _800 million_ behind mature and teen rated games.

The other 2 ratings have some strange things going on with them, one is k-a which stood for "kids through adults" was actually renamed to 'E' in 1998 so any ratings after that year won't contain any k-a. The other rating is also a very niche style of games rated for only adults. We all know what those normally contain.

A couple of interesting observations on this graph that I noticed initially were that games rated 'E' had a huge success between 2001 and 2010 as well but shrunk into a much smaller amount without knowing what the null values are but the games rated 'M' for mature have stayed at a small yet consistant count released per year with the same constraints in mind.

The graph below is actually an interactive graph that let's you hover over it and see the name of the game for each point, I know you wanted to know what that is point above all the rest.
