### The Plan

The plan for this project was to get some familiarity with Tableau in specific. Because of this, a simple dataset was chosen and the main focus is to make a dashboard in Tableau that could give some insights to a company manager of said chain.



### The Data

The data in this project came from a kaggle dataset that can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales). After a brief check on the data in SQL Server to check out values and get a quick view of the data, I deemed there was no need to do any further cleaning to complete the project I had in mind.
Since this particular chain only consists of a single store per city with a total of 3 stores, a map was out of the question. Instead I decided to go filters of product line, month and branch for the dashboard.
Another insight I was particularly interested in was the customer ratings. As described by the author of the dataset, these ratings are based on the customers shopping experience as a whole so this is a great metric to determine which areas of the stores are giving out good customer service and which are failing it hit the mark on such an important metric.


### The Dashboard

The end result of this particular project can be found here: [Tableau project](https://public.tableau.com/profile/thomas.mcdaniel3679#!/vizhome/SupermarketSales_1/SupermarketSalesData)

When building this dashboard, I was thinking of which metrics would be useful to find areas to improve upon in each store to improve sales. The distribution of customer ratings unfortunately seemed to be almost uniform across the board from 4 to 9s and less than 10% of the total ratings.
With some investigating, this metric alone could pinpoint areas of the store where the store could do some additional training to improve their rating in those areas and increase sales.
